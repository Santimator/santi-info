## Western Astrology Snapshot
- **Sun in Taurus** — keeps my research grounded; I anchor projects with patient iteration.
- **Moon in Aquarius** — fuels curiosity for collective wellbeing and experimental study designs.
- **Rising Sagittarius** — the optimistic teacher energy that shows up when presenting fieldwork stories.
- Current transit focus: balancing Saturn's structure with Venus-led creativity in collaborative teams.

## Chinese Earthly Branches & Elements
- Born in the **Wood Ox** year, so long-game strategies and persistence feel natural.
- Monthly pillar sits in **Metal Snake**, reminding me to refine details and honor intuition.
- I keep a small spreadsheet tracking how each branch/element shows up in mood, energy, and relationship dynamics.

## Rituals Under the Sky
- New Moon sketches combine ergonomic diagrams with constellation lines.
- Full Moon playlists guide restorative stretching sessions for colleagues after audits.
