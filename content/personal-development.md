## Practices That Ground Me
- **Somatic training**: 10-minute micro-sessions woven into workdays to reset posture, breathing, and attention.
- **Mindfulness journaling**: Weekly prompts centered on gratitude, boundary-setting, and tracking energy highs/lows.

## Learning Rituals
1. **Quarterly learning sprint** — 4-week self-designed program; current topic: translating lab-grade motion analysis to low-resource workplaces.
2. **Peer reflection pods** — Monthly video calls with ergonomics peers; each session ends with a tangible experiment to try before the next call.

## Micro-goals in Progress
- Publish a short explainer on biomechanical load for non-specialist audiences.
- Develop a bilingual infographic kit that unions can adapt.
- Mentor at least two undergraduate interns during upcoming field visits.
