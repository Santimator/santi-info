Welcome to my site. Feel invited to explore it at your own rhythm. You'll find different facets of my work and interests—each one something I can bring to various kinds of projects, depending on what you need.

I'm what you might call highly intellectually gifted, which in practice means I've always been deeply curious about how things work—systems, people, patterns. This has led me to explore many areas, as you'll see in my professional and personal trajectory. It started in Lyon, France, where I studied bioinformatics and modelling at INSA, learned to live abroad, handle a new language, and navigate myself and my emotions in unfamiliar territory.

From there, the path took me through Germany (cellular modeling research), back to France (software testing), to Mayotte in Africa (teaching music), and eventually to Madrid, where I've been based since 2018. Along the way I've worked in bioinformatics, project management, data analysis, credit control—each role adding another layer of understanding about how technical systems and human systems intersect.

Being trained as an engineer didn't put me off alternative theories and therapies—quite the opposite. I applied the same reason and critical thinking to approach them with a firm foot, separating wheat from chaff, and found many things that make a lot of sense. The same way I could see the contradictions in scientific organizations—at the end of the day, we're all humans doing human things.

What you'll find here reflects that journey: engineering work grounded in rigorous training, teaching informed by real classroom and performance experience, personal development practices I've studied formally (family constellations, taichi, qigong), and creative expression that's been woven throughout—clarinet performance, dance and choreography, acting, and content creation via YouTube and podcasting. I don't separate these domains—they inform each other in unexpected ways.

I work in Spanish, English, and French. Currently based in Madrid, though I work remotely and am open to projects anywhere. If you're dealing with something that sits between categories, or needs someone who can see the technical and human dimensions simultaneously, we should talk.

Take your time exploring. Each section goes deeper into a specific area. Reach out through whichever channel works for you—email is easiest, but I'm flexible.
