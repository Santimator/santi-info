I have a tendency to teach anything to anyone—music, dance, languages, mathematics—with a secret pleasure in finding the right metaphors and the proper terms to make complex ideas accessible. Teaching isn't just about transferring knowledge; it's about connection, understanding, and helping others discover their own capacity to learn.
