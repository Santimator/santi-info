I have a tendency to teach anything to anyone—music, dance, languages, mathematics, philosophy, enneagram—with a secret pleasure in finding the right metaphors and the proper terms to make complex ideas accessible. Teaching isn't just about transferring knowledge; it's about creating new worlds to expand someone's mind, and therefore life.
