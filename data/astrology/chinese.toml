# The Four Pillars (condensed)
[[pillars]]
name = "Year Pillar — 己巳"
title = "Yin Earth Snake"
description = """**Earth (己):** Internalized stability, containment, strategic patience. Absorbs, holds, and refines rather than expands.

**Snake (巳):** Analytical, observant, controlled, mentally alert. Quiet, calculating, rarely impulsive.

**Core:** Strategic thinking, self-containment, delayed action over reaction. You observe far more than you show."""

[[pillars]]
name = "Month Pillar — 丑"
title = "Yin Earth Ox"
description = """**Ox (丑):** Persistence, endurance, resistance to chaos. Works slowly but relentlessly. Strong Earth with embedded Water and Metal.

**Dominant influence:** Structurally resilient, not emotionally volatile. Prefers systems that work over ideals that sound good. Favors long-form thinking, research, and mastery over time."""

[[pillars]]
name = "Day Pillar — 己"
title = "Day Master: Yin Earth"
description = """**Your essence:** Absorptive rather than expressive. Internally structured. Values coherence and consistency. Needs time to process before acting.

Not designed for constant output. Your intelligence is digestive: you take in complexity and convert it into usable structure."""

[[pillars]]
name = "Hour Pillar — 子"
title = "Zi, Rat (Water)"
description = """**Rat (子):** Abstract thinking, curiosity, pattern recognition, mental mobility.

**Water–Earth tension:** Earth wants stability; Water wants exploration. Result: A mind that never fully rests. Externally grounded, internally mapping and recombining ideas."""

# Psychological Profile (merged elements + character)
[profile]
title = "Psychological profile"
summary = """**Elemental pattern:** Dominant Earth, secondary Water, moderate Fire. Metal present, Wood weak.

This produces a personality with strong structural intelligence but low impulsivity. You prefer depth over novelty and are skeptical of ungrounded enthusiasm. Growth comes from consciously engaging Wood qualities: initiative, flexibility, outward movement."""

[[profile.traits]]
aspect = "Temperament"
description = "Reserved, observant, internally busy. Calm exterior masking intense mental activity. Not easily swayed by emotion or fashion. Strong intolerance for incoherence or superficiality."

[[profile.traits]]
aspect = "Cognition"
description = "Systems-oriented thinker with strong memory for structure. Naturally diagnoses flaws in arguments or models. Prefers frameworks that survive stress-testing."

[[profile.traits]]
aspect = "Motivation"
description = "Security through understanding, not control. Mastery rather than dominance. Autonomy through competence."

[[profile.traits]]
aspect = "Social style"
description = "Selective, not avoidant. Prefers meaningful exchanges over frequent ones. Low need for approval, high need for earned respect."

[[profile.traits]]
aspect = "Shadow"
description = "Over-containment of emotion. Delayed action due to over-analysis. Risk of stagnation if environment becomes too rigid. Difficulty starting without internal certainty."

# Archetype
[archetype]
title = "Archetypal summary"
type = "Hidden Strategist"
description = """Not a front-line commander or charismatic leader, but a structural thinker, planner, analyst, or builder of durable systems.

You are better suited to designing, refining, diagnosing—working behind or beneath visible structures. You produce things that last, not things that impress quickly.

This is a chart associated with long arcs, not dramatic spikes."""
