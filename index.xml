Feel invited to explore it at your own rhythm.

This has led me to explore many areas, as you&amp;rsquo;ll see in my professional and personal trajectory. It started in Lyon, France, where I studied bioinformatics and modelling at INSA, learned to live abroad, handle a new language, and navigate myself and my emotions in unfamiliar territory.&lt;/p&gt;</description></item><item><title>Teaching</title><link>https://santimator.github.io/santi-info/teaching/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://santimator.github.io/santi-info/teaching/</guid><description>&lt;p&gt;Education and teaching experiences.
