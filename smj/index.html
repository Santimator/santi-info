You&rsquo;ll find different facets of my work and interests—each one something I can bring to various kinds of projects, depending on what you need.</p><p>I&rsquo;m what you might call highly intellectually gifted, which in practice means I&rsquo;ve always been deeply curious about how things work—systems, people, patterns. This has led me to explore many areas, as you&rsquo;ll see in my professional and personal trajectory. It started in Lyon, France, where I studied bioinformatics and modelling at INSA, learned to live abroad, handle a new language, and navigate myself and my emotions in unfamiliar territory.</p><p>From there, the path took me through Germany (cellular modeling research), back to France (software testing), to Mayotte in Africa (teaching music), and eventually to Madrid, where I&rsquo;ve been based since 2018. Along the way I&rsquo;ve worked in bioinformatics, project management, data analysis, credit control—each role adding another layer of understanding about how technical systems and human systems intersect.</p><p>Being trained as an engineer didn&rsquo;t put me off alternative theories and therapies—quite the opposite. I applied the same reason and critical thinking to approach them with a firm foot, separating wheat from chaff, and found many things that make a lot of sense. The same way I could see the contradictions in scientific organizations—at the end of the day, we&rsquo;re all humans doing human things.</p><p>What you&rsquo;ll find here reflects that journey: engineering work grounded in rigorous training, teaching informed by real classroom and performance experience, personal development practices I&rsquo;ve studied formally (family constellations, taichi, qigong), and creative expression that&rsquo;s been woven throughout—clarinet performance, dance and choreography, acting, and content creation via YouTube and podcasting. I don&rsquo;t separate these domains—they inform each other in unexpected ways.</p><p>I work in Spanish, English, and French. Currently based in Madrid, though I work remotely and am open to projects anywhere. If you&rsquo;re dealing with something that sits between categories, or needs someone who can see the technical and human dimensions simultaneously, we should talk.</p><p>Take your time exploring. Each section goes deeper into a specific area. Reach out through whichever channel works for you—email is easiest, but I&rsquo;m flexible.</p></section></article><div class=site-credits aria-label="Site credits"><p>Built with Hugo and Claude.
